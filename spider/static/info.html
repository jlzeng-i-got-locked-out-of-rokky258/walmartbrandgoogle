                Walmart Brand Google is a terrible site made off of a terrible idea made by terrible people for a great hackathon named
                HackUmass 0111.
            </h3>

            <p>
                We wanted a project that would challenge us and allow us to learn in areas that we were not comfortable with while still
                having fun making something.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                The Origin Story
            </h3>
            <p>
                While we were in class, dutifully not really paying attention, Adam started talking about how annoying popups were on tutorial
                sites. In response, I tried to relate to this statement by mentioning how there were a lot of sites with even more
                obnoxious popups. To my suprise, Adam told me he had never seen ads as obnoxious as I had described. So naturally, I
                went on the most shady yet safe for work website that I could think of so I could show him some absurd advertisements.
                To my suprise and utter disappointment, however, the search "Spiderman far from home movie watch online" actually
                brought me to the movie online which I could actually watch. Adam, seeing my crestfallen (I'm really exaggerating here)
                face, said "What if there was A SEARCH ENGINE FOR THOSE SITES?"
                And now there is.
            </p>
