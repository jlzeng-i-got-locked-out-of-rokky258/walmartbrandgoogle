Walmart Brand Google is a terrible site made off of a terrible idea made by terrible people for a great hackathon named HackUmass 0111.
We wanted a project that would challenge us and allow us to learn in areas that we were not comfortable with while still having fun making something.

The Origin Story
While we were in class, dutifully not really attention, Adam started talking about how annoying popups were on tutorial sites. In response, I tried to relate to this statement by mentioning how there were a lot of sites with even more obnoxious popups. To my suprise, Adam told me he had never seen ads as obnoxious as I had described. So naturally, I went on the most shady yet safe for work website that I could think of so I could show him some absurd advertisements. To my suprise and utter disappointment, however, the search "Spiderman far from home movie watch online" actually brought me to the movie online which I could actually watch. Adam, seeing my crestfallen (I'm really exaggerating here) face, said "What if there was A SEARCH ENGINE FOR THOSE SITES?" 
And now there is.
